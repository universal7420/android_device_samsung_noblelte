# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for zerofltecan hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and zerofltecan, hence its name.
#

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.

# Inherit from noblelte device

# Inherit some common Havoc-OS stuff.
$(call inherit-product, vendor/havoc/config/common_full_phone.mk)

# Set those variables here to overwrite the inherited values.
